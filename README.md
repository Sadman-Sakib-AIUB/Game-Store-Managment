# Game-Store-Managment
In a comprehensive game shop management system, there are two distinct roles: Admin and Salesman. 
The Admin has the authority to add Salesmen to the system, update or modify their own information, 
and remove any Salesman from the system as needed.  
The Admin also has the ability to access and review sales records to effectively monitor business   
performance. Additionally, the Admin is responsible for managing the shop's inventory by adding or 
removing products and Salesmen to maintain operational efficiency. 
Salesmen are tasked with updating purchase information according to customer orders. They can also                 
generate receipts based on the data entered from customer purchases. All these operations and features 
are accessible to the Admin through the system, ensuring a highly efficient, secure, and user-friendly 
management system for the game shop.
